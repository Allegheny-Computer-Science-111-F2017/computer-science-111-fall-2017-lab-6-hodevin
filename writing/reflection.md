# Reflection by Devin Ho

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. I read in the file
and printed out the input from the user. Then, I used the "substring" and
"charAt" methods. I also used the Random package from 'java.util' to generator
random numbers. "nextInt" is the method that I used for that.

The most challenging step of this lab was figuring out how to incorporate the
random number generator in order to make insertions, deletions, and
replacements in each DNA string.
